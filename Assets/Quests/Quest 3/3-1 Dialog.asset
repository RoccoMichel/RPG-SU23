    - I am responsible for getting all the timber we need to get this blimp built.
    - But there's a bunch of gobbies roaming the forest.
    - It is just too dangerous, and my axe is strictly for trees only.
    - If you could use those fists of yours and clear the forest up, I'd be delighted!

    - Thanks!
    - And be careful!
    - If you get seriously hurt you should heal up with some food!
    - Franklin has a bunch beside him.
